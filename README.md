This is a fork of a previous repository that has not been updated in eight years, and I intend to maintain this repository in hopes of fixing my DX8 and maintaining it for years to come. With the potential of slight hardware modifications to ensure that the transmitter will continue to work reliably in the years to come. 

Recent notes: upon opening my old DX8, I saw no evident hardware issues despite it not being willing to boot. This is unfortunate since it is likely an internal flash error, which was the original purpose of this repository, to try and understand 'boot0,' which may have been corrupted in my case, likely electrostatic discharge, or a bitflip from a cosmic ray, causing the internal flash to corrupt.  

Below are some of the unmodified contents of the old repository, which are not of my work. 

The `.sax` extension indicates their custom file format for describing firmware payload.
It has simple textual format, that are likely instructions for a zero-stage bootloader, let's call it `boot0`.
The file format is likely inspired by [SREC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SREC_(file_format)).

Commands are separated by `0x1a` and the known one are:

* `#`: Interpret the following string as comment.
* `T`: followed by a string, `\0` terminated. Presumably a debug message printed by `boot0`.
* `:`: ??? not sure yet. One is issued after a text command with "Erasing", and containing some address that happens to be the same where it's going to write. It looks like the first byte after `:` is a command (erasing therefore seems to be `0x10`), but there are also `0xc0`, `0xdf` and `0xef`.
* `SC`: it is followed by an address (four bytes), one byte describing the length in words (4 bytes), and up to `0x100` bytes of data. There is no checksum.
* `0xd`: followed by a `0x1a` is the end of the `.sax` file.

The address range starts of one of the firmwares I'm looking at (3.01 for DX8), starts at `0x00104000` which is sound with the information from the `AT91SAM7S512` datasheet: The internal flash is mapped to `0x001000000--0x001fffff`.

## useful commands

```
$ make
$ # get a list of strings with correct offsets in ELF
$ rabin2 -zz 3_01/spmtx.elf
```

Interesting stuff starts at `0x00146748`.

## Road to `boot0`

In order to fully understand the custom file format, we need to understand how `boot0` works.
Presumably (or hopefully), the pages on the flash storage containing `boot0` are locked in the sense of that the cannot be overwritten (that would be a good thing).
Assuming that, it would be "safe" to temper with a `.sax` file and if something goes wrong, we could just fall back to the official firmware file and restore the firmware on the device.
However, that's just a dangerous assumption: What if the pages of `boot0` aren't locked and thus we may end up bricking the device?

Thus, I propose the following attack plan:
* reverse the firmware, identify the part where it reads configurations from a SD-card.
* find buffer overflow vuln.
* exploit it, dump flash content to SD-card (assuming that those pages are readable in firmware mode).
* have `boot0`.

With that we can safely analyze `boot0` and decide if tempering with the `.sax` file is safe enough.
